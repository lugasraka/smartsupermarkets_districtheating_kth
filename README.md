My master project at KTH Applied Heat &amp; Refrigeration lab, in collaboration with Assoc. Prof. Samer Sawalha. It was a fun and challenging one, but I learned a lot about thermodynamics and scripting in this work.

## description of workflow
The thermodynamics models were mainly developed using EES (engineering-equation solver), a MATLAB like scripting software that has very nice packages for refrigeration system.

## outcomes
Thanks to KTH and Samer's generosity, I was able to present this semester project at an annual conference back then in Valencia, Spain.

I felt a bit 'off' at the event because mostly were PhD students or senior researchers, but in the end the discussion parts were very constructive!
